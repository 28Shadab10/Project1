      <b>Project : Employee Management System - </b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>About :</b><br />

      This focused on the employees of an organisation , to keep a record of
      their names , email, password, gender, contact details.The details were
      entered manually and was stored in the database (PSQL) so that it could be
      fetched later. This basically focused on the CRUD Operation where C stands
      for create, R for read, U for update and D for delete. The user can add a
      new employee, update the details of an already existing employee, can view
      all the existing employees and delete any employee’s record.The frontend
      was made using JSP which comprised of HTML pages. It helped in navigating
      through operations and pages while clicking buttons .The concept of
      primary ket ,foreign key ,different commands of PSQL, relation of one
      table to another, Servlet Mapping, Tomcat Configuration ,HTML, CSS, forms,
      buttons were learnt.This was running on a local server Tomcat.

      <b>Project : Customer Management System -</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>About :</b><br />

      This had the bank details that is the bank name , IFSC Code, customers’s
      name and other relevant details of a customer having an account in a bank.
      The details were entered manually by the user on a form which was made
      using JSP .After clicking on the submit button the records were saved on
      the database in a tabular form and which could be fetched later. This
      basically focused on the CRUD Operation where C stands for create which
      means adding new records,R for reading the already existing records in the
      database, U for updating an existing record in the database and D for
      deleting the records.These operations can also be done using the queries
      of the database. The frontend was designed using the JSP(JAVA Servlet
      Pages) and the backend was designed using SpringBoot. The basics of
      SpringBoot , and running the program without having any frontend using
      Postman , Tomcat Configuration was learnt.This was running on a local
      server Tomcat.
